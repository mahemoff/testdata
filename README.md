TestData
========

Some easily-manipulated test resource serves to help HTTP client developers
simulate various conditions, including error conditions, in a deterministic way.

Installing
==========

1. git clone
2. bin/make.sh
3. ensure public web folder is pointing at web/

Docker
======

There's a Dockerfile here. If you have Docker installed, you can run the project with something like:

docker build -t testdata . && docker run -p 8765:8765 -it testdata

Then point to http://0.0.0.0:8765

File Serving
============

File serving example:

~220MB mp3 with no length info
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=human&type=audio/mpeg&length=false

~220MB mp3 with wrong length info
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=human&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

~10MB mp3
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=meta&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

~10MB mp3 with variable bitrate
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=metavbr&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

~tiny mp3
> http://testdata.player.fm/file.php?name=freakowild&type=audio/mpeg&length=123456

Find more filenames and file types (ogg etc) in the git repo (see bin/media.sh script for now)

Arguments

* name (default: freakowild) - mp3 filename (see git repo for options)
* length (default: true) - the response length header you want. "true" means guess actual length, "false" means no length or server's default.
* predelay (default: 0) - a delay before sending
* postdelay (default: 0) - a delay after sending
* type (default: true - note this is broken in production now due to a pending Dreamhost issue) - the response content header you want. "true" means guess actual type, "false" means no type or server's default.
